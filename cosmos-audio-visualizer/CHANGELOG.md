# Changelog - Cosmos Audio Visualizer

## Recent Updates

### File Size Validation & Limits
**Date:** 2025-10-25

#### Problem Identified
- Large WAV files (>20MB) would fail to play on mobile devices
- No feedback to users about why files weren't working
- Browser memory exhaustion on mobile devices
- Users confused about file size limitations

#### Root Cause
- Mobile browsers have strict memory limits (~20MB for media files)
- WAV files are uncompressed (10x larger than MP3)
- Example: 3-minute WAV = 30MB (exceeds mobile limit)
- No validation was preventing oversized file uploads

#### Solution Implemented
1. **File Size Detection**
   - Checks file size before loading
   - Different limits for mobile (20MB) vs desktop (100MB)
   - User-agent detection for device type

2. **User Feedback**
   - Alert message when file too large
   - Shows actual file size and maximum allowed
   - Helpful tips for file conversion
   - Status bar shows file size on successful load

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added error listener for audio loading failures
   - Helpful error messages with solutions
   - Console logging for debugging

#### Files Modified
- `public/js/visualizer.js` (lines 371-420): Added file size validation and error handling

#### New Limits
- **Mobile (iPhone/Android)**: 20 MB maximum
- **Desktop**: 100 MB maximum
- Files display size in MB in status bar
- Helpful alert with conversion tips if file too large

#### User Experience
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Knows why file didn't work
- ✅ Gets actionable solutions

- Changed from generic `accept="audio/*"` to comprehensive format list
